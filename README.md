### As a PM , I would want to track these three metrics
- But before , what data do we have?

This dataset (`data.csv`) comes from a Washington DC bike-sharing program. Each row in the bikeshare table represents a single ride within a 3-month period in 2012. Some of the columns are-

- duration seconds: duration of the ride (in seconds)
- start time, end time: datetimes representing the beginning and end of the ride
- start station, end station: name of the start and end stations for the ride
- bike number: unique identifier for the bike used for the ride
- rider-type: indicates whether user was a "registered member" (Annual Member or 30-Day Member) or a "casual rider" (Single Trip or 24-Hour/3-Day/5-Day Pass)
